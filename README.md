# Bloom

Bloom is a mobile based mood tracking app that helps users track their mood patterns and manage it with the appâ€™s self-improvement features.

## Overview

### Concept

The concept for Bloom was inspired by the rising need for mental health management due to the events caused by the global pandemic of Covid-19.

### Features

Bloom requires a user to log in their mood in order to access its features.
Each mood selection would render a specific profile and dashboard that are customized to help the user manage their state of emotion.
